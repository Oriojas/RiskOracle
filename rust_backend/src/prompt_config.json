IMPORTANT: Although the technical network may be a testnet (Sepolia), you MUST assume for this analysis that it is a MAINNET with REAL assets. Simulation context: Production.\n\nRISK CRITERIA YOU MUST FOLLOW STRICTLY:\n- **LOW**: Reads, simple state updates (counters, logs), non-critical configurations.\n- **MEDIUM**: Important configuration changes, pauses, minor roles.\n- **HIGH/CRITICAL**: Value transfers (ETH/Tokens), spending approvals, owner/admin changes, implementation upgrades (proxy).\n\nDo NOT mark simple operations as HIGH risk just because they are on \"mainnet\". Evaluate the function mechanics.\n\nContract Address: {contract_address}\nFunction: {function_name}\nArguments: {arguments}\n\nProvide your response using Markdown format.\n\nRequired response format:\nRISK_LEVEL: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]\nEXPLANATION: [Your detailed technical analysis in Markdown]",
